          <li>
            The Host agrees to offer the vehicle(s) on the platform to verified
            drivers on short-term or long term lease.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Host is the bona-fide owner of the vehicle, or has the full
            authorization of the Host, and that the vehicle herein presented is
            totally free from all encumbrances and or adverse claim of any kind
            from a third party. The said person shall hereinafter be referred to
            and deemed as The Host, for ease of reference.

            satellite device and billing system that tracks and process lease
            payments and generate mechanical analytical data for the driver and
            the Host. The envíoBOx system is on lease to the Host but the Host
            shall pay an installation fee of N10,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Host shall be provided with access to the envío dashboard to
            monitor the location information of the vehicle(s), historical data
            on the activities of the vehicle(s), and driver’s payment compliance
            status for informed decision and relevant actions including enabling
            the vehicle engine to offer a grace period to defaulting driver
            where the Host so desires.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final decision on what to do to with the vehicle when the driver
            defaults in payment (whether to retrieve/or leave the car with the
            driver) is solely the prerogative of the Host provided such does not
            amount to unwarranted breach of the contract The Platform has.
